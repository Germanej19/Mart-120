  <h2>Book Summary</h2>
  <p><i>Paulo Coelho's</i> enchanting novel has inspired a devoted following around the world. This story, dazzling in it's powerful simplicity and soul-stirring wisdom, is about an Andalusian shepherd boy named Santiago who travels from his homeland in Spain to the Egyptian desert in search of a treasure buried near the Pyramids. Along the way he meets a Gypsy woman, a man who calls himself king, and an alchemist, all of whom point Santiago in the direction of his quest. No one knows what the treasure is, or if Santiago will be able to surmount the obstacles in his path. But what starts out as a journey to find worldly goods turns into a discovery of the treasure within. Lush, evocative, and deeply humane, the story of Santiago is an eternal testament to the transforming power of our dreams and the importance of listening to our hearts.</p>

  <p>That summary came straight from the book itself. And as it states, it teaches people to follow their hearts and dreams in an incredibly relatable and humane way. However, it's deeper than that to me. I have struggled in an incredibly mentally unhealthy way to find my purpose in life and direction. My yearn to know what I am supposed to be doing consumed me, and became detrimental to my health. After reading this book, I realized the answer is not black and white. I have realized that your purpose in life is to search for it. A lot of people say "It's not about the destination, it's about the journey" and that is more or less true in my eyes. It is nonetheless a scary thought, knowing you may never have an immutable answer, however, it has brought me much comfort. This book, its imagery, its down-to-earth way of speaking, and all its other nooks have completely changed my life and my mindset towards life. 11/10 a must read.</p>
